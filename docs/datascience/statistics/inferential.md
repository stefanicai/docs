# Inferential statistics

Inferential Statistics helps us to draw conclusions about a population by analyzing a representative sample from the population.

## Random variable
Assigns a numerical value to each outcome of an experiement. It assumes different values with different probability.

### Discrete random variable
Can have a limited number of values. E.g. `x` is a variable that can be:
- 0, with prob 0.95
- 1, with prob 0.04
- 2, with prob 0.008
- 3, with prob 0.002

We are able to list all the possible values - thus discrete.
> Note that the probabilities together should sum up to 1 (i.e. 100%)

### Continuous random variable
We can't specify the value. E.g. a variable that's any `float` number in between 0 and 1. There are in infinite values in between, depending on what precision you're going to. You can't list all those values.

## Probablity distribution
Discribes the values that a random variable can take.

### Discrete probability distribution
Probability for a discrete random variable value. It is described by a `probability mass function`, which gives a value to the chance a random variable taking a particular value out of the distribution.

### Continuous probability distribution
Described by a `probability density function`, which helps determine the probability with which a randome variable lies between two given numbers.
