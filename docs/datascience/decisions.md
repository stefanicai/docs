# Paradigms in Data Science

Both the below are critical. In short, inferential is about the methodology to draw conclusions based on data, computational is supporting that as well as sometimes the representation of the data in a nicer format.

## Inferential data science

Inference means: I'm seeing something/numbers, what does it imply/mean? It is about answering a question.

Inferential data science focuses on drawing conclusions and making predictions from data, using statistical models and hypothesis testing

- Making predictions based on sample data.
- use statistical methods to draw conclusions/inferences from data
- 

## Computational data science

This is about any kind of calculation - computer based or not. It is about exploring the data.

Leverages algorithms, cost and complexity of training large models etc.

Computational can also be used for generating insights. Explaining in a nicer way (e.g. graphs, charts etc) of conclusions drawn from inferential
